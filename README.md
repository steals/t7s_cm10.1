CyanogenMod 10.1 for Hyundai T7S
==========

Copy all these directories to your CM10.1 repo (usually android/system/device).
Sync Cyanogenmod sources (repo sync -j16)
Invoke 'lunch cm_t7s' to prepare for building.
Invoke 'mka'

Note: this is early work, probably will not produce a working image (i.e will brick your tablet).
I'm only releasing this in order for some more knowledgeable ppl to work on it.

Best of luck.
